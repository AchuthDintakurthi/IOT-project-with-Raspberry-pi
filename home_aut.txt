note points:

	wifi:
		change ur hotspot username and password, so raspberry automatically connected to ur hotspot when it boot
		
		username : Rasberry
		password : 123456789

		username: KTraspi123
		passware: raspberry123

		once, login go to dashboard and home_automation u get graphical pictures, their we controle the loads of ur projects
